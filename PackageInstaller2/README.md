#Assesment-Template
This small project was setup to be a starting point for your assesment.

The config and scripts folders are part of the testing setup, and shouldn't need to be altered. You'll mainly be working inside of the src folder. There's a stubbed out function that you will alter. Here's how to use this repo:

1. Run ```npm run test``` to see the two current tests run
1. Notice that one passes and one doesn't pass.
1. Start by getting the failed test to pass
1. Add more tests and expand your code's functionality to complete the assesment's description.
